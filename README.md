Trippie is a travel planning application for tourists of all types. Our services allow you to plan your trips, from flights to lodging to attractions. It allows you to create trip itineraries that organize important information about each destination, as well as transportation plans between these places. Trippie has both web and native iOS applications to provide travellers the flexibility to plan ahead or on the fly. With Trippie you can plan your time at each destinations, which includes lodging and event data. You can then connect destinations with transportation arrangements. Trippie displays your entire trip to you in quick and easy to use manner.

The web interface is optimised for creating and populating your trip before you leave, whereas iOS and mobile interfaces are more suitable to viewing the information on the go.

A user would be able to manage trips, which are containers for all related destinations and travel arrangements. Users would be able to add destinations (cities, places, etc.) that they plan to visit on their journey. Users would we able to enter information about their lodging plans, such as date, time, location, price, etc. Users will be able to add events to their trip and link them to a destination. An option to connect destinations with various travel methods (flying, driving, etc.) will be available. While travelling, users will be able to see their current travel progress based on their time and location. Users will also get notifications about their upcoming arrangements (eg. visiting a destination). Users will be able to access all of their trip information quickly using an iOS app while being offline.

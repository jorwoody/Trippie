Trippie is a travel planning application, perfect for business, pleasure, or group trips. You can plan your trips, from flights to lodging to attractions. Create trip itineraries that track your progress and remind you when you are running late. Tell Trippie where you want to go and how you want to get there. Trippie will guide you along your way, keeping you up to date with expected flight departure times and weather forecasts. Trippie is an all-in-one application for planning, organizing, and sharing your travel experience, even while you are on-the-go.

If you are planning a trip, do yourself a favour and stay organized with Trippie. Record your transportation and lodging plans. Once you have reached your destination, make use of Trippie's itinerary planner and manage the scheduling of your meetings, restaurant appointments, and attractions. If you are dealing with time sensitive events, tell Trippie to send you reminders for those events. If visualizing helps you plan, Trippie can display your entire trip on a map. Even if you have lots of trips to plan, Trippie can keep track of them all.

Now that you have planned your trip, it is quick and easy to share your trip with family and friends, whether they are at home or along for the ride. If you have a social network following to appease, Trippie can help. You may upload the pictures you have taken and associate them with the locations you have travelled. People may view a map of your trip route, observe your progress, and browse through the trail of photos that you have left behind. Your family and friends will have an intimate connection with your remote experience. 

For those travelling with you, it can be hard to stay on the same page and keep everyone informed. With Trippie you can each have access to the same travel plans from early brainstorming to spelunking in desolate caves across the world. You can travel knowing that you are on the same page, getting the same directions and reminders.

Since you entrusted Trippie with your plans, trust Trippie to be with you wherever your trip may go. Feel free to plan your trip at home, but when you need to get up and go, take Trippie with you on a mobile device. If you are on your way to your flight, check departure times. If you cannot find the airport, Trippie will tell you where to go. Trippie can even remind you if you are about to run late for your scheduled transportation. When you find yourself outside your mobile device network, Trippie will remember everything you told it and will do its best to get you wherever you planned to go next.

Trippie is your all-in-one application and handy companion for any trip. You will find yourself more punctual, better prepared, and more informed. Even after you have planned everything you want, Trippie can recommend local attractions and keep you up to date with weather forecasts regarding your future arrangements. If you want a better trip experience, you want Trippie.

Technology

Trippie is mainly a responsive web application; this allows users to access Trippie using any web browser they want - regardless of platform. Trippie will access a centralized web server that uses a database to store data and is accessible anywhere internet is available. Trippie is also available as a native application on the iPhone, which has the same features as the web version, but with the speed and performance benefits that come with native iOS applications.
